Email Slicer Using Python
by: mohamed fares
This code creates a simple email slicer GUI application using the Tkinter library in Python.

The application allows the user to enter an email address, and it will extract and display the username and domain name of the email.

The main features of the application include:
- A text entry field for the user to input their email address
- A "Done!" button that triggers the email slicing functionality
- A "Reset!" button that clears the input field and result text box
- Labels and empty labels for layout and styling
- A text box that displays the extracted username and domain name

The `result()` function is responsible for extracting the username and domain name from the input email address, and displaying the results in the text box. The `reset_all()` function clears the input field and text box.
